# CS 4315 - Assignment 3 - K-means clustering 
Completed on March, 9th, 2023.

NOTE: Unable to find a way to optimize and shorten the program in a way that can create new centroids based on the number of k-cluster requested by client. 
E.g. the program can only run up to k = 4; k = 5, the program will not be able to generate new centroid #5  because there is no variable a5,b5 declared or a loop for it to run.
