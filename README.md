# CS 4315 - Assignment 3 - K-means clustering 
Completed on March, 9th, 2023. Python

# How to run
- run kmeans.py with your Python of choice
- enter name of the input text file and value of k cluster
- an output.txt file will be generated in the same folder as the datapath
- read data from output.txt onto gen.exe

# Note: 
- Unable to find a way to optimize and shorten the program in a way that can create new centroids based on the number of k-cluster requested by client. 
E.g. the program can only run up to k = 4 for task completion for the 4 input files. However, this can be resolved by adding new variable for centroid and creating an elif condition for when k = 5, 6, 7, etc..
